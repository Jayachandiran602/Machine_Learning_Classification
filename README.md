Firstly, we set the range of x and y axis then we test as same as train the values then we create two helper functions, both of which will need to predict class labels.
Factor the code into one function rather than duplicating itthen the function will display selected scores(f1-score macro average, accuracy)
Then implementMLPRegresson and learning rate to get r2 and mse resuts then set a range value to tain and test the data we will get a good learning rate grap but in multiclassifier the output will show the low accuracy rate and the size of the array will show incorect
using pipeline to calculate kmodels then split the x and y axis then plot the grap with that valuesMultilayer perceptrons are generally composed of an input layer, an output layer and 0 or more hidden layers. The size of the hidden layers is specified via the hidden_layer_sizes parameter in MLClassifier
where the the ith element represents the number of neurons in the ith hidden layer.
